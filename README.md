# Lastkajen-rs

### *(Unofficial) Rust crate for the Swedish Traffic Administration's Lastkajen download service*

### **Very early WIP! Nothing is stable!**

```toml
lastkajen = { git = "https://github.com/JmsPae/lastkajen-rs.git" }
```

***Note for international users:*** Lastkajen documentation, products and related sites are exclusively in Swedish. A translation plugin will come in handy.

Implementation is based off the [service description][1] and supports all of its current functionalities. You will need login credentials (email and password) to use the API, for which you can register [here][2].

Lastkajen is a download service for portions of the Swedish national road database (referred to as NVDB, Nationella VÃ¤g DataBas) and this crate aims to be a convenient link between your rust service and the download service. 

There are two distinct categories of datasets:

 - Published data packages generated by the administration directly.
 - User-generated files which can be generated from the Lastkajen website.

For a basic overview of the crate's functionality, see ```examples/example.rs```.
